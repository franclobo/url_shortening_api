## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/usage/usage-with-typescript) - For state management
- [TailwindCSS](hhttps://tailwindui.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

It was necessary to create a server side route handler to make the POST request to the API, because the API does not support CORS. The handler is as follows:

```js
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  if (req.method === 'POST') {
    try {
      const { url } = req.body;
      const response = await fetch('https://cleanuri.com/api/v1/shorten', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
        },
        body: new URLSearchParams({ url }).toString(),
      });

      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error('Failed to fetch');
      }

      const data = await response.json();
      res.status(200).json(data);
    } catch (error) {
      res.status(500).json({ error: error });
    }
  } else {
    res.status(405).end(); // MÃ©todo no permitido
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue to improve the project by adding more features and improving the user experience.

### Useful resources

- [Adding TypeScript types](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes#adding-typescript-types) - You can make your API Routes more type-safe by importing the NextApiRequest and NextApiResponse types from next, in addition to those, you can also type your response data.
